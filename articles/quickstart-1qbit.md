# 1QBit optimization quickstart for Azure Quantum

Learn how to use 1QBit in Azure Quantum to solve complex optimization problems.

## Prerequisites

- To complete this tutorial you need an Azure subscription. If you don't have
  an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Create an Azure Quantum workspace

You use the Azure Quantum service by adding an Azure Quantum workspace resource to your Azure subscription in the Azure portal. An Azure Quantum workspace resource, or workspace for short, is a collection of assets associated with running quantum or optimization applications.

To open the Azure Portal, go to https://portal.azure.com and then follow these steps:

1. Click **Create a resource** and then search for **Azure Quantum**. On the results page, you should see a tile for the **Azure Quantum (preview)** service.

   service](./media/azure-quantum-preview-search.png)

1. Click **Azure Quantum (preview)** and then click  **Create**. This opens a form to create a workspace.

   ![Create resource for the Azure Quantum (preview)
   service](./media/azure-quantum-preview-create.png)

1. Fill out the details of your workspace:
   - **Subscription:** The subscription that you want to associate with this
     workspace. 
   - **Resource group:** The resource group that you want to assign this workspace to.
   - **Name:** The name of your workspace.
   - **Region:** The region for the workspace.
   - **Storage Account**: The Azure storage account to store your jobs and results. If you don't have an existing storage account, click **Create a new storage account** and complete the necessary fields. For this preview, we recommend using the default values.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You must be an Owner of the selected resource group to create a new storage account. For more information about how resource groups work in Azure, see [Control and organize Azure resources with Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/control-and-organize-with-azure-resource-manager/).

1. After completing the information, click the **Providers** tab to add providers to your workspace. A provider gives you access to a quantum service, which can be quantum hardware, a quantum simulator, or an optimization service.

   > [!NOTE]
   > By default, the Azure Quantum service adds the Microsoft QIO provider to every workspace.

1. Add at least the 1Qloud Optimization Platform provider, then click **Review + create**.

1. Review the setting you've selected and if everything is correct, click **Create** to create your workspace.

> Pricing for Azure Quantum varies by provider. Please consult the information in the Providers tab of your Azure Quantum workspace in the Azure portal for the most up-to-date pricing information.

## Define your optimization problem

In this guide, you will solve a simple optimization example to get started with the optimization services of Azure Quantum. This quickstart is based on the [ship loading sample](https://github.com/microsoft/qio-samples). 

Suppose there are two ships ready to be loaded with containers and a list of containers of varying weights to be assigned to each ship. The aim of the optimization problem is to assign containers to each ship in such a way that the weight is distributed as evenly as possible between both ships.

The cost function for this optimization problem looks like the following:

$$ H^{2} = \Large(\sum_{i \in A \cup B} w_{i} x_{i})^{2} $$

This cost function has the following properties:

- If all the containers are on one ship, the function is at its highest value - reflecting that this is the least optimal solution
- If the containers are perfectly balanced, the value of the summation inside the square is ${0}$ - the function is at its lowest value. This solution is optimal.

The goal is to find the configuration that yields the lowest possible value of $H^2$.

> [!NOTE]
> For a detailed walkthrough of the problem scenario and how the cost function is constructed, please refer to the [sample](https://github.com/microsoft/qio-samples) and/or the associated [Microsoft Learn module](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/solve-quantum-inspired-optimization-problems/).

## Install the Python SDK for optimization

To implement a solution, first ensure that you have the Optimization Python SDK installed on your machine. If you haven't
installed the Optimization Python SDK already, follow these steps:

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.6 or later in case you haven't already.
1. Install [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and ensure you have **version 19.2 or higher**.
1. Install the `azure-quantum` python package.

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade azure-quantum
   ```

## Create a `Workspace` object in your Python code and log in

Now create a Python file or Jupyter Notebook, import the `Workspace` module from `azure.quantum`, and create a `Workspace` object. This is what you will use to submit our optimization problem to Azure Quantum. The value for `resource_id` can be found on the Azure Portal page for the [Quantum Workspace you created](xref:microsoft.quantum.workspaces-portal).

Once the `Workspace` object is created, you log in using the `workspace.login()` command.

```python
from azure.quantum import Workspace

# Copy the settings for your workspace below
workspace = Workspace(
    resource_id = ""   # add the Resource ID of the Azure Quantum workspace you created
)
workspace.login()
```

The first time you run this code on your device, a window might prompt in your default browser asking for your credentials.

## Generate the terms for the problem

Next, you need to transform the mathematical representation of the problem
into code. As a reminder, this is what the cost function looks like:

$$ H^{2} = \Large(\sum_{i \in A \cup B} w_{i} x_{i})^{2} $$

Below, you can see the code required to generate the terms (`Term`) of the cost function:

```python
from typing import List
from azure.quantum.optimization import Problem, ProblemType, Term

def createProblemForContainerWeights(containerWeights: List[int]) -> List[Term]:

    terms: List[Term] = []

    # Expand the squared summation
    for i in range(len(containerWeights)):
        for j in range(len(containerWeights)):
            if i == j:
                # Skip the terms where i == j as they can be disregarded:
                # w_i∗w_j∗x_i∗x_j = w_i​*w_j∗(x_i)^2 = w_i∗w_j​​
                # for x_i = x_j, x_i ∈ {1, -1}
                continue

            terms.append(
                Term(
                    w = containerWeights[i] * containerWeights[j],
                    indices = [i, j]
                )
            )

    return terms
```

> [!NOTE]
> For a detailed explanation of how this function is derived, please refer to the [shipping sample](https://github.com/microsoft/qio-samples) or the [Microsoft Learn module for optimization](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/solve-quantum-inspired-optimization-problems/).

## Create a `Problem` instance

Now that you have a way to generate the terms for the problem, let's provide a specific example and build out the cost function:

```python
# This array contains a list of the weights of the containers:
containerWeights = [1, 5, 9, 21, 35, 5, 3, 5, 10, 11]

# Create the Terms for this list of containers:
terms = createProblemForContainerWeights(containerWeights)
```

The next step is to create an instance of a `Problem` to submit to the Azure Quantum solver:

```python
# Create the Problem to submit to the solver:
problem = Problem(name="Ship Loading Problem", problem_type=ProblemType.ising, terms=terms)
```

Above, you can see that you have provided the following parameters:

- `name`: The name of the problem, used to identify the job in the Azure portal later on
- `problem_type`: In this instance, you have chosen an `ising` representation for the problem due to the way we defined the cost function, however you could alternatively have chosen a `pubo` representation.
- `terms`: These are the terms defining the cost function that you generated previously.

## Submit your problem to Azure Quantum

Next, you will submit the `Problem` instance defined to Azure Quantum.

```python
from azure.quantum.optimization.oneqbit import PathRelinkingSolver

# Instantiate a solver instance to solve the problem
solver = PathRelinkingSolver(workspace)

# Optimize the problem
result = solver.optimize(problem)
```

Here you created an instance of a `PathRelinkingSolver` solver for the problem. You could also have chosen other 1QBit solvers (for example, `TabuSearch`) without needing to change more lines of code. To see a list of the available solvers, go to the [reference page](xref:microsoft.quantum.reference.target-list#provider-1qbit).

The type `Problem` is the common parameter for all the solvers of Azure Quantum. 

You then call `solver.optimize()` and supply the `problem` as the argument. This submits the problem synchronously to Azure Quantum and returns a Python dictionary of values to save the `result` variable for parsing in the next step.

## Results readout

The final step is to transform the result returned by calling `solver.optimize()` to something human-readable. The following code takes the configuration `dict` returned by the service and prints out a list of container assignments:

```python
def printResultSummary(result):
    # Print a summary of the result
    shipAWeight = 0
    shipBWeight = 0
    for container in result['configuration']:
        containerAssignment = result['configuration'][container]
        containerWeight = containerWeights[int(container)]
        ship = ''
        if containerAssignment == 1:
            ship = 'A'
            shipAWeight += containerWeight
        else:
            ship = 'B'
            shipBWeight += containerWeight

        print(f'Container {container} with weight {containerWeight} was placed on Ship {ship}')

    print(f'\nTotal weights: \n\tShip A: {shipAWeight} tonnes \n\tShip B: {shipBWeight} tonnes')

printResultSummary(result['solutions'][0])
```

The output should look something like this:

```bash
Container 0 with weight 1 was placed on Ship A
Container 1 with weight 5 was placed on Ship B
Container 2 with weight 9 was placed on Ship A
Container 3 with weight 21 was placed on Ship A
Container 4 with weight 35 was placed on Ship B
Container 5 with weight 5 was placed on Ship B
Container 6 with weight 3 was placed on Ship B
Container 7 with weight 5 was placed on Ship B
Container 8 with weight 10 was placed on Ship A
Container 9 with weight 11 was placed on Ship A

Total weights:
    Ship A: 52 tonnes
    Ship B: 53 tonnes
```
