# Q# quantum programming language

Everything you need to know about the Q# programming language is detailed in the [Q# language guide](xref:microsoft.quantum.qsharp.overview). 
Like anything else, our [language design process](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-language#q-language-and-core-libraries-design) is open source and we welcome contributions.
For more background about the foundations and motivation behind Q#, see [Why do we need Q#?](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/qsharp/why-do-we-need-q/).  
Q# is shipped as part of the Quantum Development Kit (QDK) For a quick overview, check out [What is the QDK?](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.q-sharp). 

## What is a quantum program?

A quantum program can be seen as a particular set of classical subroutines which, when called, perform a computation by interacting with a quantum system; a program written in Q# does not directly model the quantum state, but rather describes how a classical control computer interacts with qubits.
This allows us to be entirely agnostic about what a quantum state even *is* on each target machine, which might have different interpretations depending on the machine. 

An important consequence of that is that Q# has no ability to introspect into the state of a qubit or other properties of quantum mechanics directly, which guarantees that a Q# program can be physically executed on a quantum computer.
Instead, a program can call operations such as [`Measure`](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic.Measure) to extract classical information from a qubit.

Once allocated, a qubit can be passed to operations and functions, also referred to as *callables*. In some sense, this is all that a Q# program can do with a qubit; Any direct actions on state of a qubit are all defined by *intrinsic* callables such as [`X`](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic.X) and [`H`](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic.H) - that is, callables whose implementations are not defined within Q# but are instead defined by the target machine. What these operations actually *do* is only made concrete by the target machine we use to run the particular Q# program.

For example, if running the program on our [full-state simulator](xref:microsoft.quantum.machines.overview.full-state-simulator), the simulator performs the corresponding mathematical operations to the simulated quantum system.
But looking toward the future, when the target machine is a real quantum computer, calling such operations in Q# will direct the quantum computer to perform the corresponding *real* operations on the *real* quantum system (for example, precisely timed laser pulses).

A Q# program recombines these operations as defined by a target machine to create new, higher-level operations to express quantum computation.
In this way, Q# makes it easy to express the logic underlying quantum and hybrid quantum–classical algorithms, while also being general with respect to the structure of a target machine or simulator.

A simple example is the following program, which allocates one qubit in the $\ket{0}$ state, then applies a Hadamard operation `H` to it and measures the result in the `PauliZ` basis.

```qsharp
@EntryPoint()
operation MeasureOneQubit() : Result {
    // The following using block creates a fresh qubit and initializes it
    // in the |0〉 state.
    use qubit = Qubit();
    // We apply a Hadamard operation H to the state, thereby preparing the
    // state 1 / sqrt(2) (|0〉 + |1〉).
    H(qubit);
    // Now we measure the qubit in Z-basis.
    let result = M(qubit);
    // As the qubit is now in an eigenstate of the measurement operator,
    // we reset the qubit before releasing it.
    if result == One { X(qubit); }
    // Finally, we return the result of the measurement.
    return result;
    
}
```

Our [Quantum Katas](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas#introduction) give a good introduction on [Quantum Computing Concepts](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas#quantum-computing-concepts-qubits-and-gates) such as common quantum operations and how to manipulate qubits. 
More examples can also be found in [Intrinsic Operations and Functions](xref:microsoft.quantum.libraries.overview.standard.prelude).
